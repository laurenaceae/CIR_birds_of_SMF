Importing table to use
```{r}
# import from input_interactive
avesdata <- read.csv(here("data", "input_interactive", "all_diet_common_sum.csv"))

```

Process table
```{r}
# remove numbering of species
avesdata$X <- NULL

# switch order of columns
avesdata <- avesdata[,c(1,2,3,4,5,6,8,7)]

```

Status column:

- NN = Non-native
- V = Vagrant
- SM = Summer migrant
- WM = Winter migrant
- R = Resident
- I = Incidental

Nativity/Residency status definitions:

NN = Non-native
- Species which are introduced/non-native to the region, and which have established successful breeding populations.

V = Vagrant
- Species which are considered outside of their normal range when found here. Also known as "accidental". 

SM, WM = Summer Migrant, Winter Migrant
- Native species which are only found in this region during their winter or summer migration.

R = Resident
- Native species which are found here year-round.

I = Incidental
- Native species which are commonly found in this region, but are not typically found in this habitat or area.

To sort data, click on column headings. To filter data, use the search bar in the box under each column heading. Entering a number in the Observed column will filter for all species with more observations than that number. Species with an asterisk in the Introduced column are those which are non-native to the region and have established successful breeding populations. Diet categories include avivores (bird eating), carnivores (animal eating), herbivore (plant eating), insectivore (insect eating), and omnivore (animal and plant eating), piscivore (fish eating)."
