# Birds of the San Marcos Foothills Preserve: Who, what, when, and where?

Channel Islands Restoration is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit based in Santa Barbara, CA. We manage the San Marcos Foothills Preserve (SMF) where we are restoring habitat, providing public access and educational opportunities, and conducting ecological research. 

### Research questions: 

- What bird species are present on the preserve?
- When do different birds and bird guilds typically use the preserve?
- How does bird diversity change over the course of a year?
- How have trends in bird visitation changed over long periods of time?
- How does sampling effort affect the data?
- What kinds of birds breed on the preserve?

Using this information we will update our docent manual for the preserve and our website which has a list of species observed and other ecological information. We may also use the information on social media, reports and applications for grants, outreach, and other uses. Findings from this analysis are displayed at https://www.sanmarcosfoothills.org/birds

### Key:

Status column:

- NN = Non-native
- V = Vagrant

Nativity/Residency status definitions:

NN = Non-native
- Species which are introduced/non-native to the region, and which have established successful breeding populations.

V = Vagrant
- Species which are considered outside of their normal range when found here. Also known as "accidental". 

SM, WM = Summer Migrant, Winter Migrant
- Native species which are only found in this region during their winter or summer migration.
